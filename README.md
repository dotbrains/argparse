# ArgParse â˜•

*Argument parsing done right based on Java.*

Argument parsing is difficult and some times hard to implement. So, my goal was to find a way to ease that pain through the creation of an argument parsing library.

## Requirements

Maven and `make` are required to build the delivery service CLI.

## Make

To build the CLI application, run the following command:

```bash
make jar
```

## Running

To run the CLI simply run the following command:

```bash
java -jar target/example.jar # [commands here]
```

## Usage

```text
java -jar example.jar [COMMANDS]
```
